                android:text="Italy, officially known as the Italian Republic, is a country rich in history, culture, and natural beauty. As the heart of the Roman Empire and the birthplace of the Renaissance, Italy has made profound contributions to art, architecture, politics, philosophy, and science throughout human history.

Rome, the capital and largest city, is famed for its ancient ruins, including the Colosseum and the Roman Forum, as well as being the seat of the Vatican City—the spiritual and administrative center of the Roman Catholic Church. Other iconic cities such as Venice, Florence, and Milan are renowned for their cultural heritage, fashion, and art.

Italy operates as a parliamentary republic, with a President as the head of state and a Prime Minister as the head of government. Its legislative system consists of a bicameral parliament made up of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.

Geographically, Italy is known for its boot-shaped peninsula, the Alps in the north, and a long Mediterranean coastline. It features diverse landscapes ranging from mountainous regions and volcanic islands to rolling countryside and coastal plains. Its climate varies from alpine in the north to Mediterranean in the south."
